Problem Statement:

Develop a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wine based on its chemical composition. 
The goal is to classify wine quality using a Random Forest Classifier, leveraging input features such as 
fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, 
sulphates, and alcohol composition. Hyperparameter tuning will be conducted using GridSearchCV to optimize the modelâ€™s performance. 
The model will be deployed as a user-friendly web application via Streamlit, allowing users to input chemical properties of a 
wine sample and receive a quality prediction in real-time.
